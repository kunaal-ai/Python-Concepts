# Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable/immutable. Allows duplicate members.
# execution faster than list, because stores in single memory block instead of small as list
# use only if value will remains constant
# no append, del, remove allowed
# Indexing, -ve indexing, slicing, count, iteration => same as list

states = ('oh','il','cl','in')
print(states)

# single item tuple
tuple_a = ('single_item',)
